### Exploring Japan in a BEV - a personal project maintained by an electric vehicle owner in Japan.

In many aspects Japan is lagging behind in the electric revolution. EVs are just no option for many residents

This blog tries to look at owning a BEV beyond the use in cities and as gadgets.
This is real life - long distance drives, family trips, utility runs, camping - you name it.

I strife to write from an objective perspective - not as a fanboy.

I am convinced that, even in Japan, EVs can do what gasoline powered cars can - and then some.

# Important notes

-   This blog is not about proving that EVs will save the planet. Everyone should be completely aware that there are many more pieces to this puzzle. But letâ€™s face it - gasoline cars will never be emissions free - EVs play a vital role in decarbonization.

-   I own a Tesla. I am not a Tesla fanboy, nor do I want to convince people that Tesla makes the best EVs. The reason why I went for a Tesla? The Supercharger network. Public charging infrastructure is embarrassingly bad. Hopefully that will change in the future. I will always make an effort to include options for non Tesla cars and I hope readers can share their experiences in the comments.
